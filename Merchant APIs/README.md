# Merchant API
The merchant APIs are the handles made available for merchants thus enabling them to interact with Danske Bank MobilePay AppSwitch backend.

The APIs are listed per function and there may be several versions available in each folder, but Danske Bank recommends to use the latest version always.

## AppSwitch best practice example
In order to ensure a smooth user experience, we recommend all merchants follow our best practice implementation example.
The guide will show how to implement AppSwitch in a manner that is able to handle exceptions.

In short, the idea is to show merchants how we would like them to handle exceptions. The illustrations are responsive via links, clearly marked in red.
