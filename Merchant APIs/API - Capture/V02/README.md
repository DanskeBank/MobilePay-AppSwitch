# CaptureV02 service #
The service captures the transaction, i.e. carries out the actual payment. Used together with reservations where the full amount or a partial amount will be captured. When CaptureType = P (set in the SDK) partial capture is possible. For CaptureType = N (set in the SDK) only capture of full amount is possible.
