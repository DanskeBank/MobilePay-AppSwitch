#RequestV01 service
The RequestPayment service requests money from a customer. The customer will receive a push notification on the phone with a request for a payment to the merchant. If a request is made to a customer, and the payment later needs to be refunded, the same customer ID must be sent to the Refund service. Thus it is necessary to keep track of which orders are sent to which customers.

All payment requests will expire after five minutes, though it will only be checked every 5 minutes. If a request is sent 1 second after there is a check for expiration, it will actually be active for 9 minutes and 59s. The next check for expiration will happen in 4 minutes and 59 seconds, and at this time, the request hasn’t expired, because 5 minutes have not passed yet since the request was sent. The next check for expiration will happen 5 minutes later, at this point the request will have been active for 9 minutes and 59 seconds, and will thus expire.
