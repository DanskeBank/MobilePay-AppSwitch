# SOAP library

This folder contains example implementations in .NET, Java and Ruby on how to interact with Danske Bank's SOAP services.

The [MobilePay AppSwitch API implementation guide](https://github.com/DanskeBank/MobilePay-AppSwitch/blob/master/MobilePay%20AppSwitch%20API%20Implementation%20Guide.pdf "MobilePay AppSwitch API implementation guide") describes the SOAP library integration (chapter 5).

### .NET implementation
The Db.SoapLibrary.Specification is a set of best practice examples intended for inspirational use.

When using this library in production code please consider the following:
+ How to store and look up certificates. When arriving at a secure solution to this, some code changes are probably required in the Db.SoapLibrary.
+ Specific handling of errors and error scenarios.

### Java implementation


### Ruby implementation

Please read the [Ruby AppSwitch](https://github.com/DanskeBank/MobilePay-AppSwitch/tree/master/SOAP%20library/Source/Ruby) documentation and examples to get started using the Ruby client.
